          is a craft cann@bi$ brand and a smokeâ‚©ear label born in Seoul and
          raised in California. We imagine an alternate green, hazy universe
          where God in her highest inhales and exhales to create the world. Our
          mission is to globalize [redacted] by serving great, reliable highs
          and illustrating narratives that contextualize and de-stigmatize the
          plant.

          We are a team of product-oriented, mission-driven creatives and
          midnight tokers. As a team comprised of immigrants, LGBTQIA+, and
          people of color, we are committed to building an industry and
          community that reflects everyone, not just the lucky few. In line with
          our commitment to diversity and equity, we donate 1% of our sales
          through Beam, and work specifically with minority owned businesses -
          from equity-owned flower businesses in California to garment factories
          hiring the single-parents in Seoul. We make it a priority to partner
          with people and brands who reflect our ideals.
